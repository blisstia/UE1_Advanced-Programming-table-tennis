# UE1_Advanced-Programming-table-tennis
This is a project completed by Tingyu and Chenyin, about the recognition and tracking of objects related to a table tennis match. We started it by realizing the tracking mission under ideal conditions, and then we tried to achieve our target in a wider and more realistic table tennis match, for this we need to get into the field of machine learning.
